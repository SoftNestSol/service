## TODO

- [ ] Once you forked the repo and decided on your project, update your service's README.md to include a detailed description of your service. This should be 1-2 paragraphs outlining what you aim to deliver, both in terms of features and also architecture, integration, etc.
- [ ] A complete demo of the lab project presented by each team, including:
 - What does the project do, how is it used
 - Technology stack (code and infrastructure)
 - Deployment, Monitoring, Alerting, Logging

Use the following naming convention for your branches:
e.g. feature/add-login
e.g. bugfix/fix-login
Use clear commit messages:
e.g. [DOC] Add details to Readme.md
e.g. [API] Add login feature

Reduce all commits to 1 on your feature branch before merging the PR (using rebase and squash).
Each PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before being merged into the main branch.

- [ ] Implement basic application functionality until next Lab
- [ ] Implement at least one complete functionality, involving both the API and the database
- [ ] We dedicate two labs for implementing the complete application functionality

# Prerequisites

For using Github Codespaces, no prerequisites are mandatory.
Follow the [./PREREQUISITES.md](./PREREQUISITES.md) instructions to configure a local virtual machine with Ubuntu, Docker, IntelliJ.

# Access the code

* Fork the code GitHub repository under your Organization
  * https://github.com/UNIBUC-PROD-ENGINEERING/service
* Clone the code repository:
  * git@github.com:YOUR_ORG_NAME/service.git

# Run code in Github Codespaces

* Make sure that the Github repository is forked under your account / Organization
* Create a new Codespace from your forked repository
* Wait for the Codespace to be up and running
* Make sure that Docker service has been started
    * ```docker ps``` should return no error
* For running all services in docker:
    * Build the docker image of the hello world service
        * ```make build```
    * Start all the service containers
        * ```./start.sh```
* For running / debugging directly in Visual Studio Code
    * Start the MongoDB related services
        * ```./start_mongo_only.sh```
    * Start the Spring Boot service by clicking `Run` button inside Visual Studio Code
* Use [requests.http](requests.http) to test API endpoints

NOTE: for a live demo, please check out [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/-9ePlxz03kg)

# Run/debug code in IntelliJ
* Build the code
    * IntelliJ will build it automatically
    * If you want to build it from command line and also run unit tests, run: ```./gradlew build```
* Create an IntelliJ run configuration for a Jar application
    * Add in the configuration the JAR path to the build folder `./build/libs/hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* Start the MongoDB container using docker compose
    * ```docker-compose up -d mongo```
* Run/debug your IntelliJ run configuration
* Open in your browser:
    * http://localhost:8080/hello-world
    * http://localhost:8080/info

# Deploy and run the code locally as docker instance

* Build the docker image of the hello world service
    * ```make build```
* Start all the containers
    * ```./start.sh```

* Verify that all containers started, by running
  ```
  service git:(master) ✗  $ docker ps

  ```
* Open in your browser:
    * http://localhost:8080/hello-world
    * http://localhost:8080/info
* You can test other API endpoints using [requests.http](requests.http)
* You can access the MongoDB Admin UI at:
  * http://localhost:8090
